<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Image example for bot](https://i.imgur.com/gc7o1Kd.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/gc7o1Kd.png)

This bot hooks as additional connection into your already existing bot for your [tf2pickup.org](https://github.com/tf2pickup-org/server) instance.

It offers a single `!winrate <Arguments>` command to show exactly that. To get more info about it, you can run `!winrate help` or `!winrate ?`. Then you will be shown the following text: 

```
Please use the command the following way: !winrate <player> [<<teammate>][><enemy>][!<<not teammate>][!><not enemy>][|<days since>].
Examples:
!winrate Jack | 30 -> Show Jack's winrate in the last 30 days an
!winrate Jack < Rising < amp-t -> Show the winrate of Jack with all games where Rising and Amp-T were in his team.
!winrate Jack!<danny!>danny|30 -> Show the winrate of Jack from all games in the last 30 days, in which danny was neither in his team, nor in the opponent team
```

This help command should already explain all the features available.
Localisation is available for german and english. For more see the following chapter.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running you can either manually set up NodeJS on your system or use the provided Dockerfile.

### Prerequisites

In both cases you will need to configure your own `.env` file. Take a look at the `example.env` file, fill in your own data and rename it to .env.

A Configuration might look like this:

```dotenv
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="My Nice Token"
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://winrate-reader:nice-password@localhost:8001/"
LOCALE="de"
DOMAIN="tf2pickup.de"
```

<br>

**As you can see the user here is winrate-reader**. 

This is because for the local installation of tf2pickup.de a special new user was added called winrate-reader. This user can access the tf2pickup.de database, but only has read permission and no write permission. **This is for the case that updates of the main repo change the database layout**. I suggest also creating a user with only read permissions. Should you break anything by supplying a connect string of a root user, it is your own fault.

### Setup with NodeJS

This assumes you have a recent enough version of NodeJS and NPM installed on your system.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NetroScript/TF2Pickup.org-WinrateBot.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Then to run the application: 
   ```sh
   npm run run 
   ``` 
   or 
   ```sh
   node build/index.js
   ``` 
   
Should you want to do your own changes, do them in the `src` directory and execute

   ```sh
   npm run compile
   ``` 

once before running the application again.

### Setup with Docker

You can use the provided Dockerfile directly or just use docker-compose to make it even easier. 

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NetroScript/TF2Pickup.org-WinrateBot.git
   ```
2. Build the docker image and run it using docker-compose
   ```sh
   sudo docker-compose up
   ```
   
If you want to do any changes, you need to stop the container, build the image again with

   ```sh
   sudo docker-compose build
   ```

before you start the container again. The exception here is changes in the `.env` file.
